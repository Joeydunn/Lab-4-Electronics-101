# Lab-4-Electronics-101
For this iteration of the BlinkLED Lab you will see our circuit diagram under the .github folder and our code for the LED. For our hardware we used a breadboard, argon, LED, and 220 ohm resistor. To build the hardware:

Place the argon in the middle of the breadboard with one or two columns open in between it and the rails.
Connect the LED anode (or long side) in the same row as the D6 pin on the argon.
Connect the LED cathode (or short side) to the positive rail.
Connect one side of the 220 ohm resistor to the same positive rail as the LED.
Connect the other side of the 220 ohm resistor to the same row as the ground pin on the argon.
